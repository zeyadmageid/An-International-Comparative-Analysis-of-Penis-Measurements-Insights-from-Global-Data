# An-International-Comparative-Analysis-of-Penis-Measurements-Insights-from-Global-Data

## Overview

This data science project focuses on analyzing penile measurements data from various countries. The primary objectives of the project were:

1. Conducting data analysis on penile measurements.
2. Creating scatterplots and statistical graphs to visualize trends and patterns in the data.
3. Exploring correlations between penile measurements and other variables.
4. Collecting and incorporating average height data for each country to study relationships between height and penile measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains penile measurements for different countries. It includes variables such as length, girth, and other relevant metrics. Additionally, data on average height for each country was scraped and integrated into the analysis. The dataset was obtained from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antimoni/international-study-on-male-genital-measurements

## Key Project Files

- `data.csv`: The main dataset used for analysis.
- `height_data.csv`: Data on average height for each country.
- `penile_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis code.
- `visualizations/`: Folder containing scatterplots, statistical graphs, and correlation plots.
- `readme.txt`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Data Analysis

The data analysis process includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of penile measurements.
- Creation of scatterplots to visualize relationships between different measurement metrics.
- Generation of statistical graphs to identify trends and variations.
- Calculation and visualization of correlations between penile measurements and average height.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the analysis and visualizations:

1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the `analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries were used for this project:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- BeautifulSoup

You can install these libraries using pip if you don't already have them installed.

## Results

The project's findings and insights are documented within the Jupyter Notebook (`analysis.ipynb`). Please refer to this notebook for detailed analysis results, visualizations, and conclusions.

## Acknowledgments

This project would not have been possible without the availability of the penile measurements dataset and height data from various sources. We would like to thank the original data providers and the data science community for valuable insights and resources.
